<p>Every day there's a new piece of tech or software that comes out that is the new answer to a problem. I can't help but get excited about it and want to sign up immediately. But I try and hold fire and just relax with the idea that this 'problem' is probably already solved with very low-tech means, or that I didn't even realise it was a 'problem' in the first place so it doesn't need a fancy new solution. Then I try and keep going with what I've got. (<em>Try</em> is an important word here, I don't always succeed...)</p>

<p>I had a conversation with my 3.5 year old son while we cycled home last night, while looking at the bright half moon in the sky. We talked about how it would get bigger, until it was a full moon. I asked him what he thought would happen after it had become a full moon and he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All the astronauts and people and aliens will come to the moon and eat all the cheese. Then the cheese will grow again and they will come back and eat it and it will happen again and again and again and again.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the idea the moon gets bigger and smaller because there's a monthly cheese eating party!</p>

<p>Watching youtube these days is basically just watching a long advert for something that is interrupted by shorter adverts for other things :(</p>

<p>Listened to an interesting conversation on The Great Simplification podcast titled <a href="https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episode/rr05-hine-smaje-thiel">Food &amp; Community in the Ruins</a>. Yearning for more connection with land and community. Actually just sitting indoors staring at laptop.</p>
