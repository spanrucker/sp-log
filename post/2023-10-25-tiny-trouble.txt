experimenting with using the digitakt as midi and fx hub for the perfourmer, as well as playing a simple field recording of a leave being crumpled. I made the left input on the digitakt have zero effects and the right input have full effects sends (reverb and delay) so on the performer I could use the panning knob as a kind of effect send - left being fully dry signal, right being wet.
