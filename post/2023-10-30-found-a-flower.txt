Playing with a keyboard split on the keystep pro so I can play different voices on the perfourmer at the same time, left hand doing bass on channel 1, right hand doing melody on channel 2. It feels much more alive to play this way and there's a lot to explore with bringing in voices on the Perfourmer which are set to the same midi channel to add layers and development...
