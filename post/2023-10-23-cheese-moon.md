I had a conversation with my 3.5 year old son while we cycled home last night, while looking at the bright half moon in the sky. We talked about how it would get bigger, until it was a full moon. I asked him what he thought would happen after it had become a full moon and he said:

>> "All the astronauts and people and aliens will come to the moon and eat all the cheese. Then the cheese will grow again and they will come back and eat it and it will happen again and again and again and again."

I love the idea the moon gets bigger and smaller because there's a monthly cheese eating party!
