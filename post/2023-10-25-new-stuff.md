Every day there's a new piece of tech or software that comes out that is the new answer to a problem. I can't help but get excited about it and want to sign up immediately. But I try and hold fire and just relax with the idea that this 'problem' is probably already solved with very low-tech means, or that I didn't even realise it was a 'problem' in the first place so it doesn't need a fancy new solution. Then I try and keep going with what I've got... Unless it's _really_ new and shiny.
